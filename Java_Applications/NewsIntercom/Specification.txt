The application refers to a news-company intercommunication system.

There are three roles.

The administrator that creates, deletes, updates Users and views the transacted messages between Editors and Writers.

The editors that view and create messages and can also  completely delete messages.

The writer can view his messages as well as temporarily delete them as they will still exist in the database.


Basic messaging interactions are: create message, forward message, reply to a message, delete message(can be viewed by the user as deleted message).

The editors can additionally correct a message, send to all writers and completely delete a message.
